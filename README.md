AWE Media Center
==============

Media center for OS X, Linux, and Windows based on generalized file launchers.

# Features

The idea behind AWE Media Center (AWEMC) is simple: using players, built in or otherwise, to launch media.  That sounds simple, but many media centers make the issue much more complicated than they need to.

 + Supports the creation of media players based on external executables and command line arguments.
 + Sometimes, a media player might be something other than a file launcher, e.g. an online video service. In such a case, a developer can release an extension of AWE Media Center to support that service. The service is launched much like a file.
 + Media files are organized via folders and collected from other places on the computer. A folder's contents can be displayed and sorted in different ways, e.g. grid view vs. list view.
 + You can set up a scraper (or use one of the included ones) in order to collect metadata about each file in a folder. This includes: icon images (could be multiple), fanart images, description, genre, producer, etc. There are built in scrapers for <http://thetvdb.com/>, <http://themoviedb.org/>, and <http://gamefaqs.com/>.
