There are three kinds of media items\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Folder}s, which contain other media items.
\item {\ttfamily Media\-File}s, which represent media to be played by a media player.
\item {\ttfamily Media\-Service}s, which represent standalone apps for media.
\end{DoxyItemize}

All media items have relevant metadata and a {\ttfamily \char`\"{}type\char`\"{}}, which is either {\ttfamily \char`\"{}folder\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}file\char`\"{}}, or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}service\char`\"{}}. The {\ttfamily metadata} tag is defined in the corresponding media type. Note that there is an item type and a media type, which are two separate things.

\section*{Folders}

{\ttfamily Folder}s are rather self explanatory\-: they contain other items. The J\-S\-O\-N file structure is as follows\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}{
    "type": "folder",

    "metadata": {
        // metadata for the specific media type goes here
    },

    "items": [
        // list of relative paths to the contained items' JSON files
    ]
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


\section*{Media Files}

{\ttfamily Media\-File}s represent a file with a default ../player/\-R\-E\-A\-D\-M\-E.md \char`\"{}media player\char`\"{}, as follows\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}{
    "type": "file",

    "metadata": {
        // metadata for the specific media type goes here
    },

    "player": "player name",
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


\section*{Media Services}

Unlike {\ttfamily Folder}s and {\ttfamily Media\-File}s, {\ttfamily Media\-Service}s are not found in the {\ttfamily root} folder. They are found inside the {\ttfamily services} folder. The J\-S\-O\-N file found in {\ttfamily root} is very simple as follows\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}{
    "type": "service",

    "name": "service name"
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


The {\ttfamily \char`\"{}name\char`\"{}} points to the specific service to place in that {\ttfamily Folder}.

Inside of the {\ttfamily services} folder, there are two sub folders\-: {\ttfamily json} and {\ttfamily plugin}.

\subsection*{External J\-S\-O\-N Services}

The {\ttfamily json} folder contains a set of J\-S\-O\-N files that represent external applications to launch. Each of these J\-S\-O\-N files look like this\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}{
    "name": "service name",

    "command": "terminal command to run"
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Internal Plugin Services}

The {\ttfamily plugin} folder contains a set of J\-S\-O\-N files and associated dynamic libraries. In order to create the plugin you should implement the {\ttfamily Media\-Service} interface. The accompanying J\-S\-O\-N file looks like this\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}{
    "name": "service name",

    "library": "dynamic library file"
} \end{DoxyVerb}
