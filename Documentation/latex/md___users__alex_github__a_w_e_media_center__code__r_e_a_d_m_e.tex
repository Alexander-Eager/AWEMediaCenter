A\-W\-E\-M\-C is programmed using C++ and relies on \href{http://www.qt-project.org/}{\tt Qt}, \href{http://curl.haxx.se/}{\tt c\-U\-R\-L}, and (eventually) \href{http://libsdl.org/}{\tt S\-D\-L}. \href{http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net}{\tt Json\-Cpp} is included in the source code.

There are 7 central concepts you should understand\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Media items are organized in a folder structure using J\-S\-O\-N files to hold metadata and such.
\item Media players play media files.
\item Media services are standalone applications, like a web browser, Netflix, or i\-Tunes.
\item Metadata scrapers get relevant information and images for a media item.
\item Media types describe the default metadata values for a collection of items, like Movies or T\-V Shows.
\item Folder generators make a folder structure with organization based on things like Genre for a specific media type. They also use metadata scrapers to collect information about media items to be placed in the folder structure.
\item Skins describe the way the U\-I looks and give default images to files.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also, all classes built into A\-W\-E\-M\-C should be prefixed by \char`\"{}\-A\-W\-E\char`\"{}.
